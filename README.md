# OpenRoad_based_3DPDK_Creation_Framework
The **OpenROAD 3D PDK Creation Framework** extends the OpenROAD ecosystem to enable **native 3D Process Design Kit (3D PDK)** creation and integration.   It provides an automated flow for combining multiple 2D PDKs (LEF, Liberty, and DB files) into a cohesive **multi-tier 3D technology stack**.
